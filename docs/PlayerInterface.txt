Our Player interface would be a standard interface that is open to being implemented. Within this interface we would have a method that toggles if the concrete player is active and a method that gets if the player is active. Additionally if our model didn't directly handle the gameflow we would include the board mutating methods such as move(x,y) that would make a move to coordinate x,y. Additionally we would make a method getPlayerStatus that determines if the player won or is still activley playing a game.
